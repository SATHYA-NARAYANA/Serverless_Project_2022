# Creating IAM User with access control:
An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user is an entity that you create in AWS to represent the person or application that uses it to interact with AWS. A user in AWS consists of a name and credentials.

An IAM user with administrator permissions is not the same thing as the AWS account root user.
# Step 1: Go to AWS management console and Search IAM
